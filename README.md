# Summary
The Duelist mod adds a new playable character, Yugi Moto. Yugi has an expansive set of 1400+ new cards, all adapted from real Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. This mod also adds 30+ new relics and 25+ new potions. None of the content added with this mod should affect the base game, and none of the relics or potions are added to the shared pool (i.e. they are only obtainable when playing as The Duelist), with the sole exception of the Millennium Puzzle, which may show up in the shop for all other characters.   

This is a work in progress, and there will likely be some bugs and minor issues. I will do my best to address any unforeseen problems that arise, and of course I will be doing my own continued playtesting and debugging. Expect periodic updates. My contact information is listed at the end of this description if you would like to reach me directly with issues/feedback/bug reports/suggestions/hate mail. Thanks for playing!
